# Cool-Random-Repository

# Introduction
Welcome to the Cool Random Repository, where you will see a lot of random things that you can download! It could be software (made by random people that want to contribute, not copyrighted software), games (once again, #ade by random people that want to contribute, but not copyrighted games or game characters), photos (you get the point now), and more! There is one thing for sure, there will always be something in here that will give you delight, however, downloading everything in here, will probably fill up a lot of space depending on how many files are in this repository at the time you are reading this. But, I hope you enjoy this big huge package of random awesomeness!

# Want to add something?
Software, games, photos, videos, text file, whatever! You can submit your file to us through pull requests! However it must follow the following guidelines:
1. No viruses.
2. No NSFW content. 
3. Little kids might somehow know how to use Github, and download this, so keep it kid friendly, keep cursing to a minimum if you are making a game or software, and don't make it bloody, some violence is fine, like Kingdom Hearts sorta violence if you know what I mean. With photos are videos, no cursing, no blood, no violence.

After all of that you should be good for a pull request! After that, I will make sure to look at it as fast as I can, and if I like it and if it follows all of the guidelines, then your all set! I will let you know if your file made it in or not by replying. 
Thank you guys so much for contributing! Thanks for adding to the fun.
